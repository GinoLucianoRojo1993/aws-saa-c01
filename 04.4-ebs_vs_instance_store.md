# Instance Storage
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html

An instance store provides temporary block-level storage for your instance. This storage is located on disks that are physically attached to the host computer. Instance store is ideal for temporary storage of information that changes frequently, such as buffers, caches, scratch data, and other temporary content, or for data that is replicated across a fleet of instances, such as a load-balanced pool of web servers.


# Comparing to EBS

- Instance Store Volumes are also called Ephemeral Storage
- Instance store volumes cannot be stoppred. If the underlying host fails, all data will be lost.
- EBS backed instances can be stopped and keep the data on this instance.
- You can reboot both, you will not lose your data.
- By default, both ROOT volumes will be deleted on termination however with EBS volumes, you can tell AWS to keep the root device volume.
