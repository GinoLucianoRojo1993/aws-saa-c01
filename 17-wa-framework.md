The Well-Architected Framework has been developed to help cloud architects build secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure for their applications. Based on five pillars — operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, and cost optimization — the Framework provides a consistent approach for customers and partners to evaluate architectures, and implement designs that will scale over time.

The framework is based on five pillars:

  + [Security](17.01-security.md)
  + [Reliability](17.02-reliability.md)
  + [Performance Efficiency](17.03-performance-efficiency.md)
  + [Cost Optimization](17.04-cost-optimization.md)
  + [Operational Excellence](17.05-op-excellence.md)
