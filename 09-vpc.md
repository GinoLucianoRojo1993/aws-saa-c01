# Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that you've defined. This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.

_Exam Tips_:
- Think of a VPC as a logical datacenter in AWS
- Consists of IGWs (or Virtual Private Gateways), Route Tables, Network Acces Control Lists, Subnets, and Security Groups
- 1 Subnet = 1 AZ
- Security groups are Stateful; Network Access Control List are Stateless;
- NO TRANSITIVE PEERING
