# Route53

Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service. You can use Route 53 to perform three main functions:

**Register domain names**
Your website needs a name, such as example.com. Route 53 lets you register a name for your website or web application, known as a domain name.

**Route internet traffic to the resources for your domain**
When a user opens a web browser and enters your domain name (example.com) or subdomain name (apex.example.com) in the address bar, Route 53 helps connect the browser with your website or web application.

**Check the health of your resources**
Route 53 sends automated requests over the internet to a resource, such as a web server, to verify that it's reachable, available, and functional. You also can choose to receive notifications when a resource becomes unavailable and choose to route internet traffic away from unhealthy resources.
