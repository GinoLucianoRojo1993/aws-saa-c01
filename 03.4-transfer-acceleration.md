Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your client and an S3 bucket. Transfer Acceleration takes advantage of Amazon CloudFrontâ€™s globally distributed edge locations. As the data arrives at an edge location, data is routed to Amazon S3 over an optimized network path.

### Why Use Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration?
You might want to use Transfer Acceleration on a bucket for various reasons, including the following:
- You have customers that upload to a centralized bucket from all over the world.
- You transfer gigabytes to terabytes of data on a regular basis across continents.
- You are unable to utilize all of your available bandwidth over the Internet when uploading to Amazon S3.
