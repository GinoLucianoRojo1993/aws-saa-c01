# Amazon API Gateway
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/welcome.html

Amazon API Gateway is an AWS service that enables you to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure your own REST and WebSocket APIs at any scale. You can create robust, secure, and scalable APIs that access AWS or other web services, as well as data stored in the AWS Cloud. You can create APIs for use in your own client applications (apps). Or you can make your APIs available to third-party app developers.

## Benefits of API Gateway
- Support for stateful (WebSocket) and stateless (REST) APIs
- Integration with AWS services such as AWS Lambda, Amazon Kinesis, and Amazon DynamoDB
- Ability to use IAM roles and policies, AWS Lambda Authorizers or Amazon Cognito user pools to authorize access to your APIs
- Usage plans and API keys for selling your API as SaaS
- Canary release deployments for safely rolling out changes
- CloudTrail logging and monitoring of API usage and API changes
- CloudWatch access logging and execution logging, including the ability to set alarms
- Ability to use AWS CloudFormation templates to enable API creation
- Support for custom domain names
