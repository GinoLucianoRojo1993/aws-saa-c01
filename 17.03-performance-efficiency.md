https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/architecture/AWS-Performance-Efficiency-Pillar.pdf

## Selection

### Compute

- Instances
  - EC2 -- SSD, GPS, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), Burstable instance families, Advanced computing features
- Containers
  - Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) allows to run docker containers
- Functions
  - Lambda
- Elasticity

### Storage
Storage | Services | Latency | Throughput | Shareable  \
Block | EBS, EC2 | lowest | single | mounted on single instance, copies via snapshots  \
File system | EFS | low | multiple | many clients  \
Object | S3 | low | web scale | many clients  \
Archival | Glacier | up to hour | high | no 

- S3
- EBS
- EFS
- EC2 instance store
- Glacier

### Database
• Relational Online Transaction Processing (OLTP)  \
Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Aurora

• Non-relational databases (NoSQL)  \
Amazon DynamoDB 

• Data warehouse and Online Analytical Processing (OLAP)  \
Amazon Redshift 

• Data indexing and searching  \
Amazon Elasticsearch Service (Amazon ES)

### Network

Amazon CloudFront	
- Content Delivery Network (CDN)	
- Highly secure global CDN to get content to your viewers with low latency and high transfer speeds

Amazon VPC	
- Virtual Private Cloud
- Isolate cloud resources with your own private virtual network

AWS Direct Connect
- Dedicated Network Connections to AWS
- Dedicated network connection between your network and your Amazon VPC

Elastic Load Balancing
- Load Balancing
- Automatically distribute application traffic across multiple Amazon EC2 instances in the cloud

Amazon Route 53
- Domain Name Service (DNS)
- Highly available and scalable cloud DNS to connect user requests to your AWS resources

## Review

- Benchmarking
  - AWS CodeDeploy and AWS CloudFormation
- Load Testing
  - CloudWatch


## Monitoring

- Active and Passive
- Phases
  - Generation – scope of monitoring, metrics, and thresholds
  - Aggregation – creating a complete view from multiple source
  - Real-time processing and alarming – recognizing and responding
  - Storage – data management and retention policies
  - Analytics – dashboards, reporting, and insights

## Trade-offs
Technique | Applies To | Use | Gains  \
Caching | Read-heavy | Space (Memory) | Time  \
Partitioning | Write-heavy | Size & Complexity | Time  \
Compression | Large data | Time | Space  \
Buffering | Many requests | Space & Time | Efficiency  \

### Caching

- Application Level
  - Amazon ElastiCache
- Database Level
  - RDS read replicas
- Geographic Level
  - CloudFront
  
### Partitioning or Sharding
Amazon DynamoDB, which manages table partitioning for you automatically.


### Compression
CloudFront


### Buffering
Amazon SQS, which allows you to decouple producers from consumers using a queue.
