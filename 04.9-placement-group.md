# Placement Groups
https://github.com/awsdocs/amazon-ec2-user-guide/blob/master/doc_source/placement-groups.md

You can launch or start instances in a *placement group*, which determines how instances are placed on underlying hardware\. When you create a placement group, you specify one of the following strategies for the group:
+ *Cluster* – clusters instances into a low\-latency group in a single Availability Zone
+ *Partition* – spreads instances across logical partitions, ensuring that instances in one partition do not share underlying hardware with instances in other partitions
+ *Spread* – spreads instances across underlying hardware

There is no charge for creating a placement group\.
