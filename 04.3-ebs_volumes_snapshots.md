- Volumes exists on EBS --> Virtual Hard Disk 
- Snapshots exist in S3 (saved into there). 
- Snapshots are point in time copies of Volumes. 
- Snapshots are incremental - this means that only the blocks that have changed since your last snapshot are moved to S3. 
- If this is your 10st snapshot, it may take some time to create.

Snapshot of Root Device Volumes

- If you want to create a snapshot for EBS volume that serve as root device, you should stop the instance before. 
- However you can take a snap while the instance is running. 
- You can create AMI's from EBS-backed Instances and Snapshots. 
- You can change EBS volume sizes on the fly, including changing the size and storage type. 
- Volumes will ALWAYS be in the same AZ as the EC istance. 
- To move an EC2 volume from one AZ/Region to another, take a snap or image of it, then copy it to the new AZ/region. 

Volumes vs Snapshots - Security

- Snapshots(Volumes) of encrypted snapshots(volumes) are encrypted automatically. 
- You can share snapshots, but only if they are unencrypted. These snapshots can be shared with other AWS accounts or made public.
 

RAID = Redundant Array of Independent Disks

- RAID 0 - Striped, no redundancy, good performance
- RAID 1 - Mirrored, redundancy
- RAID 5 - Good for reads, bad for writes, AWS does not recommend ever putting RAID 5's on EBS
- RAID 10 - Striped & Mirrored

How can I take a snapshot of a RAID Array?
- Stop the applicaiton from writing to disk.
- Flush all caches to the disk.

How can we do this?
- Freeze the file system
- Unmount the RAID Array
- Shutting down the associated EC2 instance
