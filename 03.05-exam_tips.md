- S3 is Object based i.e. allows you to upload flat files.
- Files can be from 0 Bytes to 5TB.
- Unlimited storage.
- S3 is universal namespace (must be unique globally).
- https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/<bucket-name>.
- Read after Write consistency for PUTs of new objects.
- **Eventual Consistency** for **overwrite PUTs and DELETEs**.
- S3 - **Securing**
  - By default, they are PRIVATE
  - Access control can be changed through Bucker Policies or Access Control List
  - S3 buckets can be configured to create access logs (log all requests made to S3 bucket, can be done to another bucket or even account)

- S3 - **Encryption**
  - In transit -> SSL/TLS
  - At Rest
    - Server Side Encryption
      - S3 Managed Keys - **SSE-S3**
      - AWS Key Management Service, Managed Keys - **SSE-KMS**
      - Server Side Encryption With Customer Provided Keys - **SSE-C**
  - Client Side Encryption

- S3 - **Versioning**
  - Stores all versions of an object (including writes and deletes) 
  - Great backup tool
  - Once enabled, cannot be disabled (only suspended)
  - Versiosning MFA DELETE capability (additional level of security)
  - Cross Region replication requires versioning enabled on the source bucket
- S3 - **Lifecycle Management**
  - Can be used in conjuction with versioning
  - Can be applied to current and previous versions
  - Actions can be done:
    - Transition to the Standard - Infrequent Access Storage Class (128Kb and 30 days after creation date)
    - Archieve to the Glacier Storage Class (30 days after IA, if relevant)
    - Permanently Delete
- **CloudFront**
  - Edge Locations - content will be cached (not to mix up with AWS region/AZ), not only for reading (writing possible)
  - Objects are cached for the life of TTL (time to live), you can clear cache, but you will be charged
  - Origin = origin of the files that the CDN will distribute (can be S3 Bucket, EC2 instance, ELB or Route53)
  - Distribution = CDN which consists of a collection of EDGE Locations:
    - Web Distribution - typically for websites
    - RTMP - Media Streaming
- Storage Gateway
  - **File Gateway** -> flat files, stored directly on S3
  - **Volume Gateway**
    - Stored Volumes - entire dataset is stored on site and async-ly backed up to S3
    - Cached Volumes - entire dataset is stored on S3 and the most frequently accessed data is cached on site
  - **Tape Gateway** or **Virtual Tape Library (VTL)** - used for backup and uses popular backup applications like NetBackup, Backup Exec, Veeam etc.
- S3 Static Websites -> serverless, very cheap, scales automatically
- You can speed up uploading to S3 by enabling **multipart upload**
