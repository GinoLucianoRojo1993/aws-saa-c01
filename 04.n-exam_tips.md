- Termination Protection is turned off by default, you must turn it on.
- On an EBS-backed insance, the default action is for the root EBS volume is to be deleted when the instance is terminated.
- EBS Root Volumes can be encrypted. You can use a third party tool (such as bit locker etc) to encrypt, or this can be done when creating AMI's in the AWS console or using the API.
- Additiional volumes can be encrypted.

- Prices (know the difference)
  - On Demand
  - Spot
    - If you terminate the instance, you pay for the hour
    - If AWS terminates the spot instance, you get the hour it was terminated in for free
  - Reserved
  - Dedicated hosts
  
- EC2 Instance Types

- EBS cosists of:
  - SSD, General Puprose - GP2 (Up to 10.000 IOPS)
  - SSD, Provisioned IOPS - IO1 (More than 10.000 IOPS)
  - HDD, Throughput Optimized - ST1 - frequently accessed worloads
  - HDD, Cold - SC1 - less frequently accessed data
  - HDD, Magnetic - Standard - cheap, infrequently accessed storage
  
- You cannot mount 1 EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances; instead use EFS.

---

- Volumes exist on EBS: Virtual Hard Disk
- Snapshots exist on S3
- You can take a snapshot of a volume, this will store that volume on S3
- Snapshots are point in time copies of Volumes
- Snapshots are incremental. This means that only the blocks that have changed since your last snapshot are moved to S3
- First snapshot nay take some time to create
- Snapshots of encrypted are encrypted automatically
- Volumes restored from encrypted snapshots are encrypted automatically
- You can share shapshots, but only if they are unencrypted. These snapshots can be shared with other AWS accounts or made public
- To create a snapshot for Amazon EBS volumes that serve as root devices, you should stop the instance before taking the snapshot.

---

- Instance Store Volumes are sometimes called Ephemeral Storage
- Instance Store Volumes cannot be stopped. If the underlying host fails, you will lose your data.

---

- AMIs are regional. You can only launch an AMI from the region in which it is stored, However you can copy AMIs to other regions using the console, command line, or the Amazon EC2 API,

---

- Standard Monitoring = 5 min
- Detailed = 1 minute

- CloudWatch is for performance monitoring
- CloudTrail is for auditing

---

- CloudWatch
  - Dashboards: dashboards to see what happening with your AWS environment
  - Alarms: notify when particular thresholds are hit
  - Events: respond to state changes in AWS resources
  - Logs: aggregate, monitor and store logs
  
---

- Roles are more secure than storing your access key and secret access key on individual EC2 instance
- Roles are easier to manage
- Roles can be assigned to an EC2 instance AFTER it has been provisioned using both the CLI and AWS console
- Roles are universal - you can use them in any region

---

- Instance Metadata 
  - Used to get info about an instance
  - curl http://169.254.169.254/...
  
---

- Supports the Network File System (NFSv4) protocolo
- You pay for the storage you use (on pre-provisioning required)
- Can scale up to the petabytes
- Can support thousands of cincurrent NFS connections
- Data is stored across multiple AZs within a region
- Read After Write Consistency

---

- Lambda: Event-driven compute sercice

---

- Placement Groups: You can launch or start instances in a placement group, which determines how instances are placed on underlying hardware. When you create a placement group, you specify one of the following strategies for the group:
  - Clustered 
  - Spread
  - Partition
